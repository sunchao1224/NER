Emerging O
Markets O

never O
fully O
develop O
. O

Investments O
in O
emerging O
markets O
may O
be O
considered O
speculative O
. O

Emerging O
markets O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
experience O
hyperinflation O

chances O
that O
the O

lose O
money O
. O

These O
risks O
include O
: O

High O
Portfolio O
Turnover O
Risk O
 O
The O
Fund O

engage O
in O
active O
and O
frequent O
trading O
of O
its O
portfolio O
securities O
. O

High O
portfolio O
turnover O
( O
more O

the O
Fund O
" " O
including O
brokerage O
commissions O
" " O
dealer O
mark-ups O
and O
other O
transaction O
costs O
on O
the O
sale O
of O
the O
securities O
and O
on O
reinvestment O
in O
other O
securities O
. O

The O
sale O
of O

shareholders O
of O
higher O
capital O
gains O
or O
losses O
as O
compared O
to O
a O
fund O

less O
active O
trading O
policies O
. O

Given O
the O
frequency O
of O
sales O
" " O
such O
gain O
or O
loss O
will O
likely O
be O
short-term O
capital O
gain O
or O
loss O

increase O
an O
investor O
s O
tax O
liability O
unless O
shares O
are O
held O
through O
a O
tax-deferred O
or O
exempt O
vehicle O
. O

These O
effects O

adversely O
affect O
Fund O
performance O
. O

junk O
bonds O
generally O
pay O
higher O
rates O
of O
interest O

may O
cause O
income O
and O
principal O
losses O
for O
the O
Fund O
. O

Leverage O
Risk O
 O
Some O
transactions O
may O
give O
rise O
to O
a O
form O
of O
leverage O
. O

These O
transactions O
may O
include O
" " O
among O
others O
" " O
derivatives O
" " O
and O
may O
expose O
the O
Fund O
to O
greater O
risk O
and O
increase O
its O
costs O
. O

To O
mitigate O
leverage O
risk O
" " O
the O
Fund O
management O
team O
will O
segregate O
liquid O
assets O
on O
the O
books O
of O
the O
Fund O
or O
otherwise O
cover O
the O
transactions O
. O

The O
use O

cause O
the O
Fund O
to O
liquidate O
portfolio O
positions O
when O
it O
may O
not O
be O
advantageous O
to O
do O
so O
to O
