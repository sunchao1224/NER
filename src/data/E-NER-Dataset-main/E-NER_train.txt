EXAMPLE I-MISC
The O
Example O
is O

period O
indicated O
and O

redeem O
all O
of O
your O

The O
Example O
also O
assumes O
that O
your O

has O
a O
5 O

that O
the O
Fund O

We O

so O
a O

really O
puts O
more O
time O
on O
to O
this O
review O

And O
ultimately O
what O
we O
think O
today O
now O
is O
that O
this O
is O
a O
Q2 O
closing O

that O

Anything O
else O
in O
terms O
of O
 O
any O
other O
updates O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
acquisition O
? O

I O
know O
that O
last O
month O
" " O
you O
highlighted O
some O
synergy O
opportunities O
for O
the O
combination O
. O

Maybe O
you O
can O
go O
into O
a O
little O
more O
detail O
of O
what O
the O
amount O
was O
and O
what O
that O
s O
for O
? O

Is O
that O
a O
revenue O
and O
cost O
synergy O
or O
just O
a O
cost O
synergy O
? O

Keith I-PER
Taylor I-PER
Equinix I-ORG
" " I-ORG
Inc.CFO I-ORG

Sure O
. O

I O
think O
first O
and O
foremost O
" " O
when O
I O
look O
at O
the O
two O
organizations O
" " O
obviously O
" " O
they O
have O
 O
they O
think O
well O
together O
. O

We O
sort O
of O
existed O
in O
the O
same O
environment O
. O

So O
the O
relationship O
between O
our O
company O
and O
the O
Switch I-ORG
& I-ORG
Data I-ORG
company O
is O
very O
" " O
very O
strong O
. O

I O
think O
the O
teams O
that O
are O
working O
together O
to O
think O
about O
how O
to O
put O
the O
businesses O
together O
" " O
again O
" " O
are O
doing O
extremely O
well O
" " O
given O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
is O
going O
to O
be O
a O
merger O
of O
two O
companies O
or O
the O
acquisition O
of O
Switch I-ORG
& I-ORG
Data I-ORG
. O

That O
all O
said O
" " O
when O
you O
think O
about O
economically O
what O
s O
going O
to O
happen O
" " O
there O
is O
the O
assumption O
that O
we O
re O
going O
to O
derive O
a O
lot O
of O
synergies O
out O
of O
the O
transaction O
. O

And O
no O
matter O
what O
line O
on O
the O
P O
& O
L O
you O
look O
at O
" " O
we O
think O
that O
there O
s O
an O
opportunity O
. O

And O
" " O
certainly O
" " O
there O
are O
opportunities O
to O
remove O
costs O
that O
are O
duplicative O
. O

But O
there O
are O
also O
opportunities O
to O
get O
leverage O
off O
the O
cost O
of O
running O
a O
business O
. O

We O
have O
power O
purchase O
agreements O
with O
certain O
vendors O
in O
unregulated O
markets O
. O

They O
don O
t O
necessarily O
have O
those O
. O

And O
so O
by O
taking O
their O
contract O
and O
working O
it O
into O
our O
contract O
" " O
we O
can O
influence O
the O
overall O
costs O
of O
operating O
their O
data O
centers O
. O

Then O
you O
think O
about O
cost O
of O
capital O
" " O
we O
think O
the O
combination O
of O
the O
two O
businesses O
and O
the O
lower O
gross O
leverage O
will O
allow O
us O
to O
find O
cheaper O
sources O
of O
capital O
for O
the O
combined O
business O
. O

Then O
lastly O
" " O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
that O
when O
you O
think O
about O
tax O
and O
the O
NOLs O
" " O
there O
are O
some O
certain O
advantages O
from O
a O
tax O
perspective O
" " O
and O
so O
that O
will O
benefit O
us O
as O
well O
. O

So O
we O
put O
at O
least O
a O
floor O
into O
the O
market O
today O
saying O
we O
think O
the O
synergies O
are O
$ O
20 O
million O
or O
better O
. O

But O
I O
think O
my O
view O
is O
this O
is O
a O
great O
opportunity O
for O
the O
combination O
of O
two O
good O
companies O
and O
we O
ll O
just O
have O
to O
wait O
until O
Q2 O
and O
hopefully O
get O
through O
the O
Department I-GOVERNMENT
of I-GOVERNMENT
Justice I-GOVERNMENT
review O
. O

And O
so O
the O
synergy O
number O
I O

was O

20 O

The O
other O
part O
of O
the O
process O
with O
the O

is O
filing O
an O
S-4 I-MISC

And O
in O
its O
S-4 I-MISC
document O
" " O
Equinix I-ORG
included O
an O
outlook O
for O
revenue O
" " O
OIBITDA O
" " O
and O
CapEx O
between O
2009 O
and O
2014 O

And O
the O

that O
that O

not O

. O

Keith I-PER

But O
can O
you O
help O
investors O
understand O
how O
they O
should O
be O
using O
this O
information O
? O

And O
one O
of O
the O
things O
I O
m O
assuming O
is O
the O
09 O
CapEx O
number O
" " O
which O
is O
bigger O
than O
the O
guidance O
" " O
includes O

" " O
or O
may O
include O

. O

So O
can O
you O
help O
us O
understand O
sort O
of O
what O
s O
in O
those O
numbers O
and O
how O
investors O
should O
use O
that O
information O
? O

Keith I-PER
Taylor I-PER
Equinix I-ORG
" " I-ORG

Sure O
. O

And O
obviously O
a O
lot O
of O
that O
was O
asked O
today O
in O
our O
one-on-one O
meetings O
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
" " O
let O
me O
deal O
with O
2009 O
. O

The O
number O
that O
we O
provided O
 O
it O
s O
not O
 O
let O
me O
take O
a O
step O
back O
. O

What O
is O
included O
in O
the O
S-4 I-MISC
is O
basically O
a O
plan O
" " O
a O
plan O
of O
what O
could O
we O
do O
over O
a O
five-year O
period O
. O

That O
plan O
is O
2009 O
" " O
it O
s O
lower O
than O
projected O
guidance O
for O
2009 O
. O

In O
fact O
" " O
it O
s O
lower O
 O
and O
that O
s O
on O
the O
revenue O
line O
" " O
and O
EBITDA O
line O
. O

And O
it O
gives O
you O
outlook O
to O
2010 O
as O
well O
" " O
and O
it O
s O
slightly O
lower O
than O
what O
we O
give O
you O
on O
a O
growth O
rate O
for O
2010 O
. O

That O
all O
said O
" " O
the O
fact O
then O
because O
of O
now O
giving O
guidance O
on O
Q3 O
that O
was O
different O
than O
that O
tells O
you O
that O
we O
did O
that O
plan O
well O
in O
advance O
of O
our O
Q3 O
numbers O
. O

Q3 O
was O
a O
great O
quarter O
for O
us O
. O

By O
all O
accounts O
" " O
we O
think O
we O
knocked O
it O
out O
of O
the O
park O
. O

We O
felt O
very O
good O
about O
our O
numbers O
" " O
and O
so O
the O
numbers O
moved O
up O
. O

Now O
" " O
all O
that O
said O
" " O
embedded O
in O
that O
2009 O
disclosure O
was O
a O
CapEx O
line O
of O
$ O
509 O
million O
. O

$ O
50 O
million O
of O
that O
is O
basically O
the O
covered O
call O
that O
we O
used O
with O
the O
 O
and O
it O
was O
just O
where O
it O
got O
allocated O
in O
the O
business O
" " O
in O
the O
model O
. O

And O
recognizing O
the O
business O
model O
" " O
the O
financial O
model O
that O
we O
shared O
with O

that O

But O
$ O
50 O
million O
of O
that O
was O
the O
covered O
call O
" " O
which O
was O
" " O
again O

Keith I-PER
Taylor I-PER
Equinix I-ORG

Yes O
. O

So O
it O
was O
a O
financial O
transaction O
. O

So O
really O
the O
CapEx O
line O
there O
was O
$ O
459 O
million O
. O

Mike I-PER
Rollins I-PER
Citi I-ORG

And O
just O
thinking O
about O
the O
investment O
that O
you O
are O
making O
in O
Switch I-ORG

Data I-ORG
" " O
does O
that O
then O
count O
towards O
some O
of O
that O
revenue O
capacity O
and O
CapEx O
? O

So O
in O
a O
way O
" " O
is O
there O
a O
risk O
that O
looking O
at O
that O
plan O
is O
double O
accounting O
because O
in O
a O
way O
you O
are O
buying O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
capacity O
and O
some O
of O
the O
expansion O
that O
I O
think O
you O
were O
originally O
hoping O
to O
do O
. O

Keith I-PER
Taylor I-PER
Equinix I-ORG
" " I-ORG
Inc.CFO I-ORG

The O
plan O
did O
not O
contemplate O
any O
duplication O
with O

. O

The O
only O
place O
where O
we O
will O
get O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
 O
not O
a O
little O
bit O
 O
more O
meaningful O
capacity O
is O
in O
New I-LOC
York I-LOC
" " O
and O
we O
get O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
capacity O
in O
Dallas I-LOC
. O

But O
overall O
" " O
these O
are O
all O
new O
markets O
that O
we O
want O
 O
that O
s O
an O
organic O
plan O
where O
we O
wanted O
to O
be O
as O
an O
industry O
" " O
or O
as O
a O
company O
. O

And O
so O
that O
s O
what O
we O
think O
we O
can O
do O
. O

When O
you O
throw O
on O
Switch I-ORG

Data I-ORG
" " O
there O
s O
an O
opportunity O
that O
is O
even O
greater O
. O

So O
I O
don O
t O
think O
it O
s O
going O
to O
displace O
any O
meaningful O
CapEx O
. O

I O
think O
it O
might O
defer O
it O
for O
a O
short O
period O
of O
time O
. O

But O
in O
New I-LOC
York I-LOC
" " O
the O
biggest O
issue O
 O
and O
we O
re O
quite O
concerned O
. O

Even O
though O
we O
re O

today O

" " O
that O
we O
will O
run O
out O
of O

very O
" " O
very O
quickly O
because O
that O
gives O
you O
a O
sense O
of O
the O
pent-up O

And O
so O
just O
one O
last O
question O
on O
this O
. O

So O
the O
business O
case O

The O
new O
guidance O
enables O
distressed O
borrowers O
to O
initiate O
conversations O
with O
special O
servicers O
to O
proactively O
evaluate O
their O
mortgages O
in O
hopes O
of O
averting O
foreclosure O
. O

These O
changes O
generated O
renewed O
interest O
in O
more O
credit O
sensitive O
classes O
of O
CMBS O
as O
the O
prospects O
for O
immediate O
liquidation O
of O
delinquent O
loans O
into O
a O
depressed O
market O
diminished O
. O

However O
" " O
most O
lower O
rated O
CMBS O
positions O
still O
trade O
for O
pennies O
on O
the O
dollar O
as O
most O
investors O
recognize O
that O
the O
new O
guidance O
may O
simply O
delay O
" " O
rather O
than O
eliminate O
" " O
impending O
defaults O
. O

The O
CMBS O
market O
recently O
received O
some O
welcome O
news O
in O
the O
form O
of O
the O
first O
U.S. I-LOC
CMBS O
deal O
consisting O
of O
newly O
originated O
collateral O
issued O
in O
almost O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
. O

The O
Developers O
Diversified O
Realty O
deal O
was O
issued O
into O
strong O
demand O
and O
priced O
at O
tighter O
than O
expected O
spreads O
with O
the O
TALF I-MISC
eligible O
AAA I-MISC
tranche O
pricing O
at O
140bp O
over O

. O

The O
deal O
featured O
notable O
differences O
to O
the O
traditional O
CMBS O
structure O
" " O
including O
a O
simplified O
low O
leverage O
three O
tranche O
structure O
. O

The O
mortgage O
collateral O
was O
also O
more O
conservatively O
underwritten O
than O
those O
of O
the O
recent O
past O
" " O
with O
a O
debt O
coverage O
ratio O
of O
2.04x O
and O
an O
LTV O
of O
51.7 O
% O
2 O
. O

With O
respect O
to O
non-securitized O
CRE O
debt O
" " O
both O
statistical O
and O
anecdotal O
evidence O
points O
to O
further O
deterioration O
within O
institutional O
loan O
portfolios O
" " O
primarily O
banks O
. O

As O
of O
September O

" " O
2009 O
" " O
the O
national O
average O
default O
rate O
for O
commercial O
real O

held O

rose O
to O
3.40 O
% O
( O
up O
from O
2.88 O
% O
three O
months O

) O
. O

We O
expect O
that O
this O
deterioration O
will O
continue O
to O
put O
pressure O
on O
financial O
institutions O
. O

However O
" " O
the O
current O
low O
interest O
rate O
environment O
is O
providing O
breathing O
room O
for O
these O
financial O
institutions O
that O
hope O
to O
earn O
their O
way O
out O
of O
the O
crisis O
. O

Given O
the O
general O
uncertainty O
in O

" " O
we O
continue O

This O

The O
Example O

Counterparty O
Credit O
Risk O
The O

may O
make O

The O
Fund O

involves O
risks O
that O

Derivatives O
Risk O
The O
Fund O

may O
pose O
risks O

Early O
Closing O
Risk O
The O

subject O
to O
the O
risk O
that O
unanticipated O
early O
closings O
of O
securities O

markets O
may O
result O
in O

Leveraging O
Risk O
The O
Fund O
achieves O
leveraged O
exposure O

through O
the O
use O
of O

instruments O
. O

The O
Fund O

generally O
requires O
a O

relative O
to O
the O
amount O
of O
investment O
exposure O
assumed O
. O

As O
a O
result O
" " O
such O
investments O
may O
give O
rise O

the O
amount O

instruments O
. O

The O
more O
the O
Fund O
invests O
in O
leveraged O
instruments O
" " O
the O
more O
this O
leverage O
will O
magnify O
any O
losses O
on O
those O
investments O

The O

believes O
that O
the O

benefit O
from O

it O

the O

it O
was O
the O

opinion O
that O

better O

THE O
COMPANY O
WILL O
BE O
ABLE O
TO O

TO O

The O
Board O
of O
Directors O
believe O
that O
" " O
among O
other O
reasons O
" " O
the O
number O
of O
outstanding O
shares O
of O
our O
Common O
Stock O
have O
contributed O
to O
a O
lack O
of O
investor O
interest O
in O
the O
Company O
and O
has O
made O
it O
difficult O
to O
attract O
new O
investors O
and O
potential O
business O
candidates O
. O

The O
Board O
of O
Directors O
has O
proposed O
the O
Reverse O
Stock O
Split O
as O
one O
method O
to O
attract O
business O
opportunities O
in O
the O
Company O
. O

When O
a O
company O
engages O
in O
a O
reverse O
stock O
split O
" " O
it O
substitutes O
one O
share O
of O
stock O
for O
a O
predetermined O
amount O
of O
shares O
of O
stock O
. O

It O
does O
not O
increase O
the O
market O
capitalization O
of O
the O
company O
. O

An O
example O
of O
a O
reverse O
split O
is O
the O
following O
. O

A O
company O
has O
"10,000,000" O
shares O
of O
common O
stock O
outstanding O
. O

Assume O
the O
market O
price O
is O
$ O
.01 O
per O
share O
. O

Assume O
that O
the O
company O
declares O
a O
1 O
for O
5 O
reverse O
stock O
split O
. O

After O
the O
reverse O
split O
" " O
that O
company O
will O
have O
1/5 O
as O
many O
shares O
outstanding O
or O
"2,000,000" O
shares O
outstanding O
. O

The O
stock O
will O
have O
a O
market O
price O
of O
$ O
0.05 O
. O

If O
an O
individual O
investor O
owned O
"10,000" O
shares O
of O
that O
company O
before O
the O
split O
at O
$ O
.01 O
per O
share O
" " O
he O
will O
own O
"2,000" O
shares O
at O
$ O
.05 O
after O
the O
split O
. O

In O
either O
case O
" " O
his O
stock O
will O
be O
worth O
$ O
100 O
. O

He O
is O
no O
better O
off O
before O
or O
after O
. O

Except O
that O
such O
company O
hopes O
that O
the O
higher O
stock O
price O
will O
make O
that O
company O
look O
better O
and O
thus O
the O
company O
will O
be O
a O
more O
attractive O
merger O
target O
for O
potential O
business O
. O

There O
is O
no O
assurance O
that O
that O
company O
's O
stock O
will O
rise O
in O
price O
after O
a O
reverse O
split O
or O
that O
a O
suitable O
merger O
candidate O
will O
emerge O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
the O
reverse O
stock O
split O
may O
improve O
the O
price O
level O
of O
our O
Common O
Stock O
and O
that O
the O
higher O
share O
price O
could O
help O
generate O
interest O
in O
the O
Company O
among O
investors O
and O
other O
business O
opportunities O
. O

However O
" " O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
reverse O
split O
upon O
the O
market O
price O
for O
our O
Common O
Stock O
can O
not O
be O
predicted O
" " O
and O
the O
history O
of O
similar O
stock O
split O
combinations O
for O
companies O
in O
like O
circumstances O
is O
varied O
. O

There O
can O
be O
no O
assurance O
that O
the O
market O
price O
per O
share O
of O
our O
Common O
Stock O
after O
the O
reverse O
split O
will O
rise O
in O
proportion O
to O
the O
reduction O
in O
the O
number O
of O
shares O
of O
Common O
Stock O
outstanding O
resulting O
from O
the O
reverse O
split O
. O

The O
market O
price O
of O
our O
Common O
Stock O
may O
also O
be O
based O
on O
our O
performance O
and O
other O
factors O
" " O
some O
of O
which O
may O
be O
unrelated O
to O
the O
number O
of O

outstanding O
. O

The O
reverse O
split O
will O
affect O
all O
of O
our O
stockholders O
uniformly O

not O
affect O
any O

be O
that O

even O

As O
discussed O
below O
" " O
the O
reason O
the O
Reverse O

proposed O
is O
to O

able O
to O
issue O
in O
order O
to O
attract O

. O

This O
proposal O
is O
not O
the O
result O
of O
management O
’ O
s O
knowledge O
of O
an O
effort O
to O
accumulate O
the O
issuer O

s O
securities O

Neither O
the O
Company O

s O
charter O
nor O
its O
by-laws O
presently O
contain O
any O
provisions O

effects O

this O
proposal O
is O
not O
a O
plan O
by O
management O
to O
adopt O
a O
series O
of O
amendments O
to O
the O
Company O
’ O
s O
charter O
or O
by-laws O
to O
institute O
an O
anti-takeover O
provision O

The O
Company O

not O
have O
any O

adopt O
other O
provisions O
or O
enter O
into O
other O
arrangements O
that O
may O
have O
material O
anti-takeover O
consequences O
. O

The O
advantage O
of O
the O
Reverse O
Stock O
Split O
will O
be O
to O
permit O
the O
Company O
to O
pursue O
financing O
from O
investors O
and O
issue O
shares O
of O
common O
stock O
in O
exchange O
for O

This O
is O
the O
main O
purpose O
for O
the O
Reverse O
Stock O
Split O
and O
if O
the O
Reverse O
Stock O
Split O
is O
not O
completed O
" " O
the O
Company O
would O
not O
be O
able O
to O
issue O
additional O
shares O
sufficient O
to O
complete O
a O
financing O
. O

The O
main O
disadvantage O
to O
the O
Reverse O
Stock O
Split O
is O
that O
it O
may O
have O
an O
anti-takeover O
effect O
and O
discourage O
any O
potential O
mergers O
or O
tender O
offers O

The O
main O
purpose O
of O
completing O
this O
Reverse O

Split O
is O
to O
increase O
the O
amount O
of O

The O
Company O
is O
now O
considering O
business O
opportunities O
for O
merger O
or O
acquisition O
that O
might O
create O
value O
for O
its O
shareholders O
. O

We O
have O
no O
day-to-day O
operations O
. O

Our O
officers O
and O
directors O
devote O
limited O
time O
and O
attention O
to O
the O
affairs O
of O
the O
Company O
. O

Management O
has O
adopted O
a O
conservative O
policy O
of O
seeking O
opportunities O
that O
it O
considers O
to O
be O
of O
exceptional O
quality O
. O

Therefore O
" " O
we O
may O
have O
to O
wait O
some O
time O
before O
consummating O
a O
suitable O
transaction O
. O

Management O
recognizes O
that O
the O
higher O
the O
standards O
it O
imposes O
upon O
us O
" " O
the O
greater O
may O
be O
its O
competitive O
disadvantage O
when O
vying O
with O
other O
acquiring O
interests O
or O
entities O
. O

The O
Company O
does O
not O
intend O
to O
restrict O
its O
consideration O
to O
any O
particular O
business O
or O
industry O
segment O
. O

Due O
to O
our O
lack O
of O
financial O
resources O
" " O
the O
scope O
and O
number O
of O
suitable O
business O
ventures O
is O
limited O
. O

We O
are O
therefore O
most O
likely O
to O
participate O
in O
a O
single O
business O
venture O
. O

Accordingly O
" " O
the O
Company O
may O
not O
be O
able O
to O
diversify O
and O
may O
be O
limited O
to O
one O
merger O
or O
acquisition O
. O

The O
lack O
of O
diversification O
would O
prevent O
us O
from O
offsetting O
losses O
from O
one O
business O
opportunity O
against O
profits O
from O
another O
. O

The O
decision O
to O
participate O
in O
a O
specific O
business O
opportunity O
will O
be O
made O
upon O
management O
’ O
s O
analysis O
of O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
opportunity O
’ O
s O
management O
and O
personnel O
" " O
the O
anticipated O
acceptability O
of O
products O

marketing O
concepts O
" " O
the O
merit O
of O
technological O
changes O

numerous O
other O
factors O
which O
are O
difficult O
" " O
if O
not O
impossible O
" " O
to O
analyze O
through O
the O
application O
of O
any O
objective O
criteria O
. O

Further O
" " O
it O
is O
anticipated O
that O
the O
historical O
operations O
of O
a O
specific O
venture O
may O
not O
necessarily O
be O
indicative O
of O
the O
potential O
for O
the O
future O
because O
of O
the O
necessity O
to O
substantially O
shift O
a O
marketing O
approach O
" " O

" " O
change O
product O
emphasis O
" " O
change O
or O
substantially O

The O
Company O
will O
be O
partially O
dependent O
upon O
the O
management O
of O
any O
given O
business O
opportunity O
to O
identify O
such O
problems O
and O
to O
implement O
" " O
or O
be O
primarily O
responsible O
for O
the O
implementation O
of O
required O
changes O
. O

Since O
we O
may O
participate O
in O
a O
business O
opportunity O
with O
a O
newly O
organized O
business O
or O
with O
a O
business O
which O
is O
entering O
a O
new O
phase O
of O
growth O
" " O
it O
should O
be O
emphasized O
that O
the O
Company O
may O
incur O
risk O
due O
to O
the O
failure O
of O
the O
target O
’ O
s O
management O
to O
have O
proven O
its O
abilities O
or O
effectiveness O
" " O
or O
the O
failure O
to O
establish O
a O
market O
for O
the O
target O
’ O
s O
products O
or O
services O
" " O
or O
the O
failure O
to O
realize O
profits O
. O

The O
Company O
does O
not O
intend O
to O
acquire O
or O
merge O
with O
any O
company O
for O
which O
audited O
financial O
statements O
can O
not O
be O
obtained O
. O

Never-the-less O
" " O
management O
anticipates O
that O
any O
opportunity O
in O
which O
we O
participate O
will O
present O
certain O
risks O
. O

Many O
of O
these O
risks O
can O
not O
be O
adequately O
identified O
prior O
to O
selection O
of O
a O
specific O
opportunity O
. O

Our O
shareholders O
must O
therefore O
depend O
on O
the O
ability O
of O
management O
to O
identify O
and O
evaluate O
such O
risks O
. O

Further O
" " O
in O
the O
case O
of O
some O
of O
the O
opportunities O
available O
to O
us O
" " O
it O
may O
be O
anticipated O
that O
some O
of O
such O
opportunities O
are O
yet O
to O
develop O
as O
going O
concerns O
or O
that O
some O
of O
such O
opportunities O
are O
in O

Implementation O

On O

of O
a O
transaction O
" " O
it O
is O

that O

would O
not O
remain O

may O
" " O
as O

to O
be O
replaced O
by O
new O
officers O

directors O
without O
a O
vote O
of O
our O
shareholders O
. O

We O
anticipate O
that O
any O
securities O
issued O

be O
issued O
in O
reliance O
on O
exemptions O
from O

However O
" " O
in O

Shortly O

looking O
for O
some O

believe O
Byron I-ORG

a O
great O

The O

will O
enhance O
our O

and O
should O
further O

We O
add O

This O
is O
an O

" " O
subject O
to O
adjustment O
under O
certain O

conditions O

We O
expect O
to O
incur O
acquisition-related O
and O
integration O
costs O
of O
approximately O
$ O
6 O
million O
and O
a O
reduction O
of O
OAK I-ORG

annual O
operating O
expenses O
of O
approximately O
$ O
3.8 O
million O

Excluding O
the O
estimated O
acquisition-related O
and O

we O
expect O
the O

to O
be O
accretive O
to O

operating O
results O
in O
2010 O
and O
accretive O

We O
anticipate O
that O
the O
transaction O
will O
close O
in O
the O
second O
quarter O
of O
2010 O
" " O
and O
we O
will O

is O
one O
of O
our O
state O

will O
add O
14 O

Kent I-LOC
counties O
and O
increase O
our O
core O
deposit O
base O
by O
some O
$ O
438 O

We O
estimate O
we O
will O
jump O

a O
pro-forma O
basis O
as O
of O
December O

HARVESTING O
THE O
POTENTIAL O
IN O
OUR O
STATE O
. O

THE O
FINANCIAL O
SECTOR O
As O
alluded O
to O
earlier O
" " O
2009 O
witnessed O
the O
continuing O
of O
one O
of O
the O
most O
several O
global O
economic O
environments O
in O
decades O
. O

Michigan I-LOC
" " O
whose O
economy O
has O
been O
in O
recession O
for O
six O
years O
" " O
continued O
its O
roller O
coaster O
ride O
in O
virtually O
every O
economic O
sector O
. O

Two O
of O
our O
most O
storied O
corporations O
" " O
General I-ORG
Motors I-ORG
and O
Chrysler I-ORG
" " O
filed O
for O
bankruptcy O
. O

The O
failures O
in O
the O
financial O
sector O
" " O
primarily O
on O
Wall I-LOC
Street I-LOC
" " O
heightened O
the O
scrutiny O
of O
virtually O
every O
bank O
in O
the O
world O
. O

This O
scrutiny O
resulted O
in O
`` O
Main O
Street O
'' O
commercial O
banks O
being O
put O
in O
the O
same O
bucket O
as O
Wall I-LOC
Street I-LOC
investment O
banks O
. O

Banking O
regulators O
closed O
140 O
banks O
in O
2009 O
. O

This O
was O
the O
highest O
number O
of O
financial O
institution O
closures O
since O
the O
end O
of O
the O
savings O
and O
loan O
association O
crisis O
in O
1992 O
" " O
when O
181 O
FDIC-insured I-MISC
depository O
institutions O
failed O
. O

Of O
the O
140 O
institutions O
closed O
in O
2009 O
" " O
four O
were O
headquartered O
in O
Michigan I-LOC
. O

Many O
of O
our O
peers O
" " O
however O
" " O
continue O
to O
operate O
in O
a O
weakened O
position O
. O

Some O
have O
received O
funding O
from O
the O
U.S. I-GOVERNMENT
Treasury I-GOVERNMENT
's O
Troubled I-MISC
Asset I-MISC
Relief I-MISC
Program I-MISC
" " O
better O
known O
as O
TARP I-MISC
" " O
in O
order O
to O
shore O
up O
their O
capital O
levels O
. O

Because O
of O
our O
strong O
capital O
base O
" " O
Chemical I-ORG
Financial I-ORG
chose O
not O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
TARP I-MISC
program O
. O

Bank O
failures O
have O
increased O
the O
cost O
of O
doing O
business O
for O
all O
banks O
. O

The O
FDIC I-GOVERNMENT
" " O
whose O
insurance O
fund O
was O
depleted O
due O
to O
the O
cost O
of O
bank O
failures O
" " O
increased O
dramatically O
the O
premiums O
all O
remaining O
banks O
must O
pay O
. O

As O
mentioned O
earlier O
" " O
Chemical I-ORG
Bank I-ORG
had O
total O
assessed O
premiums O
of O
$ O
7.0 O
million O
in O
2009 O
" " O
compared O
to O
less O
than O
$ O
1 O
million O
in O
2008 O
. O

We O
and O
all O
other O
banks O
also O
prepaid O
a O
special O
three-year O
premium O
to O
the O
FDIC I-GOVERNMENT
for O
coverage O
from O
2010 O
to O
2012 O
" " O
which O
for O
us O
amounted O
to O
$ O
19.7 O
million O
. O

As O
often O
happens O
in O
distressed O
economic O
times O
" " O
a O
wave O
of O
regulatory O
and O
legislative O
`` O
solutions O
'' O
have O
surfaced O
. O

While O
the O
total O
impact O
of O
the O
myriad O
of O
regulatory O
and O
congressional O
proposals O
is O
unknown O
" " O
it O
is O
apparent O
that O
many O
of O
these O
so-called O
reforms O
are O
aimed O
at O
perpetrators O
of O
poor O
lending O
and O
investment O
practices O
. O

Unfortunately O
" " O
it O
will O
also O
affect O
those O
of O
us O
who O
never O
participated O
in O
such O
debacles O
. O

Chemical I-ORG
Financial I-ORG
avoided O
many O
problems O
that O
have O
manifested O
themselves O
in O
these O
reforms O
by O
not O
unduly O
leveraging O
our O
balance O
sheet O
" " O
by O
maintaining O
high O
levels O
of O
liquidity O
" " O
by O
avoiding O
esoteric O
financial O
investments O
and O
by O
not O
participating O
in O
the O
subprime O
mortgage O
market O
. O

Hopefully O
" " O
regulators O
and O
representatives O
in O
Congress I-GOVERNMENT
will O
avoid O
painting O
every O
bank O
with O
the O
same O
brush O
" " O
so O
that O
our O
stakeholders O
are O
not O
adversely O
impacted O
by O
over-reactionary O
decisions O
. O
